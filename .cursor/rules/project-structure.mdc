## Project Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite located in `client/`
- **Backend**: Express.js + TypeScript located in `server/`
- **Shared**: Common types and schemas in `shared/`
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM

## Key Entry Points

- **Client entry**: [client/src/main.tsx](mdc:client/src/main.tsx)
- **Server entry**: [server/index.ts](mdc:server/index.ts)
- **App component**: [client/src/App.tsx](mdc:client/src/App.tsx)
- **Database schema**: [shared/schema.ts](mdc:shared/schema.ts)
- **API routes**: [server/routes.ts](mdc:server/routes.ts)

## Configuration Files

- **TypeScript**: [tsconfig.json](mdc:tsconfig.json) with path aliases (`@/*` for client, `@shared/*` for shared)
- **Tailwind**: [tailwind.config.ts](mdc:tailwind.config.ts) for styling configuration
- **Drizzle**: [drizzle.config.ts](mdc:drizzle.config.ts) for database migrations
- **Package management**: [package.json](mdc:package.json) with scripts for dev, build, and database operations

## Core Features

The application provides a workflow for:
1. File upload and AI analysis
2. Lesson plan generation
3. Flashcard creation
4. Summary generation

Key components are organized in `client/src/components/` with UI components from shadcn/ui in `client/src/components/ui/`.
